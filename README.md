The Weather plugin allows you to display weather forecasts on your
glFusion site, and integrate weather displays with other plugins such
as the Locator and Evlist.

Weather Underground is the default and recommended provider. You'll
need to create an account at http://wunderground.com and obtain
an API key which must be entered in the plugin's configuration.

World Weather Online is still included but no longer offers a free API
key and is no longer being tested. You should switch to Weather
Underground if you observe any issues getting weather data.
