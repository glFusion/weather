# Weather plugin for glFusion
Copyright (C) 2011-2016 by Lee Garner  lee@leegarner.com

The Weather plugin allows you to display weather forecasts on your
glFusion site, and integrate weather displays with other plugins such
as Locator and Evlist.

## Providers
#### Weather Underground
Weather Underground is the default and recommended provider.
You need to create an account at http://wunderground.com and obtain
an API key which must be entered in the plugin's configuration. The
free developer plan allows up to 10 requests per minute or 500 per day.

#### World Weather Online
World Weather Online (http://worldweatheronline.com) is still included
but no longer offers a free API key and is no longer being tested.
You should switch to Weather Underground if you observe any issues getting
weather data.

#### APIXU
http://apixu.com has been added in version 1.0.4 and offers a free API with
up to 5000 requests per month.

## Administration
There is no administration interface provided other than a link to purge the cache.
